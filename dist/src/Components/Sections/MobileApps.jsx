                                    <ul><li>- Java is commonly used for Android development.</li>
                                        <li>- JavaScript adds dynamic and interactive elements on the client side.</li>
                                        <li>- Flutter and React Native offer cross-platform solutions, allowing developers to use a single codebase for both Android and iOS.</li>
                                        <li>- XML is utilized for designing user interfaces in Android applications.</li>
                                        <li>- Django, a Python web framework, can be incorporated for backend development in mobile apps, ensuring robust server-side functionality.</li></ul>
                                    Additionally, Flutter, with Dart programming language, facilitates a smooth and expressive UI design, while React Native leverages JavaScript to build native-like experiences.

                                    XML plays a pivotal role in Android app layout design, defining the structure and appearance of user interfaces. Django's versatility extends beyond web development, contributing to the seamless integration of backend services in mobile applications, making it a valuable tool in the mobile app development landscape.
