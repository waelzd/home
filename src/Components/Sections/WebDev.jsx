                  Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites or web applications using various programming languages.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <ul><li>- HTML is fundamental for structuring content, while CSS styles and designs the layout.</li>
                  <li>- JavaScript adds dynamic and interactive elements on the client side.</li>
                  <li>- PHP facilitates server-side scripting, enabling dynamic content generation.</li>
                  <li>- Java, a versatile programming language, can be used for server-side development in frameworks like Spring.</li>
                  <li>- C++ is occasionally employed for backend development, handling complex tasks efficiently.</li></ul>
